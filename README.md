# 📌 To-Do List App

A simple, lightweight, and responsive **To-Do List** application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This app allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks while ensuring data persistence using **LocalStorage**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by clicking the "Add" button or pressing **Enter**.  
✅ **Mark as Completed**: Clicking on a task toggles the completed state.  
✅ **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button (**×**) to remove it.  
✅ **LocalStorage Support**: Tasks are saved and persist even after refreshing the page.  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Markup structure
- **CSS3** - Styling & layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Logic & interactivity
- **LocalStorage** - Data persistence

---

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Users add a task** → JavaScript creates a new `<li>` element.
2. **Users click a task** → The `checked` class is toggled (strikethrough effect).
3. **Users delete a task** → JavaScript removes it from the DOM.
4. **Data Persistence** → `localStorage` ensures tasks are saved after refresh.

## 💡 Future Improvements
🔹 Drag-and-drop reordering.  
🔹 Task categories & priorities.  
🔹 Dark mode option.
